# koa-firebase

Simple Firebase Admin Server using [Koa](http://koajs.com/).

You used Firebase for auth, realtime DB, and all. Finally you need your own server
to integrate with 3rd party services, or maybe custom token, or you need server-side operations.

## Requirements
- Node 7.6 or later

## How to use
1. Clone this repo and change directory to the cloned folder
2. Install the packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. You need to download your Firebase Service Account json file, please follow the official [instruction](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).

    Put the file at project root.

    > :warning: Always make sure the JSON file is git-ignored!

4. Copy `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` at project root.

    Change the dummy FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL value with your Firebase project databaseURL, you can find it on your Firebase Console

5. Then start the server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
6. It should log successfully, and you can start using Firebase Admin SDK
